# You can set workspace rules to achieve workspace-specific behaviors. 
# For instance, you can define a workspace where all windows are drawn without borders or gaps.

# Assigning workspace to a certain monitor. Below are just examples
# workspace = 1, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 2, monitor:eDP-1
# workspace = 3, monitor:eDP-1

# workspace = 5, monitor:DP-2
# workspace = 6, monitor:DP-2
